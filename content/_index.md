## Gameplay

Its core mechanics is a fast-paced, somewhat turn based strategy game.

## Narration
Brume take place in a suffering world, raided by an upcoming treat : the Brume.
Lowerlands are being raided by this thick fog, that drives people crazy and slowly kills them.
The Capital stands above all from its hills, but time is counted, and the Brume won't take long to climb up.
Your Quest is to retaliate, and bring back peace over the lands.

# Dev note
Hello everyone, I'm Portevent, and in this chapter I'll talk about myself and about what Brume represent for me. First, I'm really happy to be launching this page. I've been working very hard on it, and the game still have a long way to go.
But, it's for me the first occasion to really speak about Brume.

I've worked on many projects. A lot of them are related to my beloved game : Dofus. I started playing Dofus in 2017, and
never really stopped since then. I played many indie / small studio strategy game. If I had only one game to speak about,
that would certainly be Noita. I really liked it, on almost all aspects the game could offer. I'm highlighting theses two
games because I have to admit they really had an influence on me. And Brume will most likely reflect all my passion for them.

I always wanted to make that game, but never knew how to do it (technically), how to do it (the exact gameplay formula),
nor I had the motivation.

## How to do it - Technical Aspect
I made a lot of small games with Construct 1 during my "french lyc√©e" years. Over 3~5 year I did some projects, but
nothing structured or complete. I switched to Unity after that, followed the introduction tutorial and that's all. I never really
came back on it afterward, I was too busy doing other stuff (mostly playing Dofus). In a way, I had the root knowledge to
start working on Brume. But making tile-based game was something I never did before. So in order to experience with it,
I decided to make a small side project [Bolgrot] to have a hand on how to implement such gameplay mechanics. That project
helped me see what went well, and which error I made. I'm not sure to have the best pattern, but at least I'm not
starting from nothing for Brume.

## The perfect Gameplay formula
So, I had a vague idea on what gameplay I wanted to create. But, I had the feeling the outcome could really depend 
on the implementation. The two major point I want to succeed are : 
- an advanced deck building mechanic, with highly customizable spells. Different effect and synergy
- a fast-paced strategic gameplay, that rely heavily on precise movement and correct positioning

But the game enjoyability depends on the outcome of both of these task. A bad deck building with unadapted spells could ruins
the precise movement interest of the game. And a pointless fight system would kill the potential of great spells mechanics.
I decided to start working on the code functionality of the game and trying to have the finest code-quality base. Such as
I could then experiment different idea and see how it feels. I'm really hoping to unfold the game as it goes, and have
idea comes by themself. When the game will be done we will know if it was an interesting approach or not.

## The missing ingredient
So far so good, I decided to start working on this game. It went well over some week. I spent over 50 hours working on
it during Feb 2022. Then came Temporis VI, a big event on Dofus. I stopped any activity to play Dofus for 2 month. It
was refreshing, and once Temporis was over, I listed all the stuff I need to get back on track. Brume stayed in the
"will continue soon" box for almost 6 months.

One day, I came up about someone talking about various topics. All were pretty interesting, but one of them was really
pertinent. I was a criticism about the "Gameplay elitism" among game reviewer. I 100% fall into that category. I don't
give much interest in the visuals of a game, I played 90% of my games with sound off
(I only put sound for Noita, and even this, I only put sound effect with no music). I skipped ever possible cinematic,
never read dialog. The only thing that interested me in game was the gameplay, and only that. And I realized I only saw
Brume through the gameplay perspective.

That made me think a lot, and I started exploring all the possibility I had to exploit throughout narration. I have a 
lot to say, to share to other, and I may have found a way to express it. Making Brume a way for me to relate my
experiences really motivate me to get back on work. I won't give any detail on what topics I want to present, nor how
I'll do it. That would spoil the game. But don't worry, you'll see. I just need to find the right balance between
gameplay and self-expression. Anyway, the project is back, greater than ever, I hope it will keep going until the end
