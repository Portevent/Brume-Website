A HandSpell is a MonoBehaviour object that link a spell in the player's DeckManager to UI Button
It manage the icon and cooldown displayed  
Currently the cooldown system is based on local cooldown value saved within HandSpell. Probably need to rework this
(this can cause glitch and abuse, and anyway not a good pattern
